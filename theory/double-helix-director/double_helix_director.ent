Suppose
$\mathbf
{v}(\mathbf
{x})$
is
a
vector
field.
Take
$L$
to
be
a
linear
transformation.
We
would
like
to
act
on
$\mathbf
{v}$
by
$L$
in
an
\textit
{active}
way.
This
means
that,
if
$L$
rotates
a
plane
by
some
angle
$\theta
$,
then
we
are
imagining
taking
$\mathbf
{v}$
(say
on
a
piece
of
paper)
and
rotating
the
whole
thing
by
the
angle
$\theta
$.
There's
two
pieces
to
this:
i)
is
that
we
must
act
on
each
of
the
vectors
outputted
by
$\mathbf
{v}$
by
$L$
(again,
think
of
rotating
a
vector
field
printed
on
a
piece
of
paper).
ii)
is
that,
if
we
want
to
get
the
correct
vector
field
at
$\mathbf
{x}$,
we
must
actually
sample
$\mathbf
{v}$
at
a
point
$L^{-1}\mathbf
{x}$.
This
is
because
$L^{-1}\mathbf
{x}$
is
the
point
that
will
get
mapped
to
$\mathbf
{x}$
by
$L$.
