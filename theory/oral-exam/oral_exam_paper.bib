	abstract = {We study the active flow around isolated defects and the self-propulsion velocity of \$+1/2\$ defects in an active nematic film with both viscous dissipation (with viscosity \${\textbackslash}eta\$) and frictional damping \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ with a substrate. The interplay between these two dissipation mechanisms is controlled by the hydrodynamic dissipation length \${\textbackslash}ell\_d={\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}eta/{\textbackslash}Gamma\}\$ that screens the flows. For an isolated defect, in the absence of screening from other defects, the size of the vortical flows around the defect is controlled by the system size \$R\$. In the presence of friction that leads to a finite value of \${\textbackslash}ell\_d\$, the vorticity field decays to zero on the lengthscales larger than \${\textbackslash}ell\_d\$. We show that the self-propulsion velocity of \$+1/2\$ defects grows with \$R\$ in small systems where \$R{\textless}{\textbackslash}ell\_d\$, while in the infinite system limit or when \$R{\textbackslash}gg {\textbackslash}ell\_d\$, it approaches a constant value determined by \${\textbackslash}ell\_d\$.},

They profoundly affect the viscoelastic behaviour of the fluid by constraining the orientational structure in a way that inevitably requires global changes not achievable with any set of local deformations. In active nematic liquid crystals, topological defects not only dictate the global structure of the director, but also act as local sources of motion, behaving as self-propelled particles. In this article, we present a detailed analytical and numerical study of the mechanics of topological defects in active nematic liquid crystals.},

Here we show that the elasticity of a liquid crystal system consisting of a dense suspension of semiflexible biopolymers can be manipulated over a relatively wide range of elastic moduli. Specifically, thin films of actin filaments are assembled at an oil–water interface. At sufficiently high concentrations, one observes the formation of a nematic phase riddled with

              topological defects, characteristic of a two-dimensional nematic system. As the average filament length increases, the defect morphology transitions from a U shape into a V shape, indicating the relative increase of the material’s bend over splay modulus. Furthermore, through the sparse addition of rigid microtubule filaments, one can gain additional control over the liquid crystal’s elasticity. We show how the material’s bend constant can be raised linearly as a function of microtubule filament density, and present a simple means to extract absolute values of the elastic moduli from purely optical observations. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict not only the static structure of the material, including its topological defects, but also the evolution of the system into dynamically arrested states. Despite the nonequilibrium nature of the system, our continuum model, which couples structure and hydrodynamics, is able to capture the annihilation and movement of defects over long time scales. Thus, we have experimentally realized a lyotropic liquid crystal system that can be truly engineered, with tunable mechanical properties, and a theoretical framework to capture its structure, mechanics, and dynamics.},

The Oseen–Frank theory can be recovered from the derived Q-tensor theory by making a uniaxial assumption, and the coefﬁcients in the Oseen–Frank model can be examined. In addition, the smectic-A phase can be characterized by the derived macroscopic model. In the second part, we derive a new dynamic Qtensor model from Doi’s kinetic theory by the Bingham closure, which obeys the energy dissipation law. Moreover, the Ericksen–Leslie system can also be derived from new Q-tensor system by making an expansion near the local equilibrium.},

Under the assumption of rotational dynamics for the Q-tensor, the variational principles underling the two theories are equivalent and the conservative VK theory emerges as a specialization of the QS model. Also, after presenting a micropolar variant of the VK model, Rayleigh dissipation is included in the treatment. Finally, the treatment is extended to account for non-trivial eigenvalue dynamics in the VK model and this is done by considering the effect of scaling factors in the evolution of the Q-tensor.},

Polymer microprism arrays are fabricated using soft embossing with elastic polydimethylsiloxane molds and ultraviolet curable resins. Surface profiling measurements show that the dimensions of the replicated prisms closely approximate those of the master prism. Two different LC alignment techniques were employed: hybrid rubbing alignment and obliquely evaporated SiO2 alignment, both of which result in proper alignment of the LC molecules along the prism groove direction. The operation voltage of the LC components is relatively low (10 V-rms). The steering angle of a green laser beam was experimentally studied as a function of applied voltage, and a steering range of 3 degrees was found. The active LC components also effectively deflect a collimated white light beam over a steering angle of about 2 degrees with an efficiency of 27\%-33\%. All the optical measurements are in agreement with theoretical calculations based on Snell's law.},

	abstract = {We adapt the Halperin–Mazenko formalism to analyze two-dimensional active nematics coupled to a generic ﬂuid ﬂow. The governing hydrodynamic equations lead to evolution laws for nematic topological defects and their corresponding density ﬁelds. We ﬁnd that ±1/2 defects are propelled by the local ﬂuid ﬂow and by the nematic orientation coupled with the ﬂow shear rate. In the overdamped and compressible limit, we recover the previously obtained active self-propulsion of the +1/2 defects. Non-local hydrodynamic effects are primarily signiﬁcant for incompressible ﬂows, for which it is not possible to eliminate the ﬂuid velocity in favor of the local defect polarization alone. For the case of two defects with opposite charge, the non-local hydrodynamic interaction is mediated by non-reciprocal pressure-gradient forces. Finally, we derive continuum equations for a defect gas coupled to an arbitrary (compressible or incompressible) ﬂuid ﬂow.},

However, the complexity of scaling to such large machines and problem sizes has so far prevented the emergence of generic software libraries that support such computations, although these would lower the threshold of entry and enable many more applications to benefit from large-scale computing.
            We are concerned with providing this functionality for mesh-adaptive finite element computations. We assume the existence of an “oracle” that implements the generation and modification of an adaptive mesh distributed across many processors, and that responds to queries about its structure. Based on querying the oracle, we develop scalable algorithms and data structures for generic finite element methods. Specifically, we consider the parallel distribution of mesh data, global enumeration of degrees of freedom, constraints, and postprocessing. Our algorithms remove the bottlenecks that typically limit large-scale adaptive finite element analyses.
            We demonstrate scalability of complete finite element workflows on up to 16,384 processors. An implementation of the proposed algorithms, based on the open source software p4est as mesh oracle, is provided under an open source license through the widely used deal.II finite element software library.},

Since standard "black box" packages may be too inefficient if the number of matrices is large, we study several alternatives. We consider optimized implementations of the Jacobi, QL, and Cuppen algorithms and compare them with an analytical method relying on Cardano's formula for the eigenvalues and on vector cross products for the eigenvectors. Jacobi is the most accurate, but also the slowest method, while QL and Cuppen are good general purpose algorithms. The analytical algorithm outperforms the others by more than a factor of 2, but becomes inaccurate or may even fail completely if the matrix entries differ greatly in magnitude. This can mostly be circumvented by using a hybrid method, which falls back to QL if conditions are such that the analytical calculation might become too inaccurate. For all algorithms, we give an overview of the underlying mathematical ideas, and present detailed benchmark results.

Many application problems require the consideration of matrices of size three with spectral decomposition over the real numbers. If the functional dependence of the spectral decomposition on the matrix elements has to be preserved, then closed-form solution approaches must be considered. Existing closed-form expressions are based on the use of principal matrix invariants which suffer from a number of deﬁciencies when evaluated in the framework of ﬁnite precision arithmetic. This paper introduces an alternative form for the computation of the involved matrix invariants (in particular the discriminant) in terms of sum-of-products expressions as function of the matrix elements. We prove and demonstrate by numerical examples that this alternative approach leads to increased ﬂoating point accuracy, especially in all important limit cases (e.g. eigenvalue multiplicity). It is believed that the combination of symbolic algorithms with the accuracy improvements presented in this paper can serve as a powerful building block for many engineering tasks.},

The work in this paper is not new research, rather it is an introductory guide for anyone wishing to model a system using such a theory. A more complete mathematical description of this theory, including a description of flow effects, can be found in numerous sources but the books by Virga and Sonnet and Virga are recommended. More information can be obtained from the plethora of papers using such approaches, although a general introduction for the novice is lacking. The first few sections of this paper will detail the development of the \$\{{\textbackslash}bf Q\}\$-tensor approach for nematic liquid crystalline systems and construct the free energy and governing equations for the mesoscopic dependent variables.

              We demonstrate the relevance of saddle-splay elasticity in nematic liquid crystalline fluids in the context of complex surface anchoring conditions and the complex geometrical confinement. Specifically, nematic cells with patterns of surface anchoring and colloidal knots are shown as examples where saddle-splay free energy contribution can have a notable role which originates from nonhomogeneous surface anchoring and the varying surface curvature. Patterned nematic cells are shown to exhibit various (meta)stable configurations of nematic field, with relative (meta)stability depending on the saddle-splay. We show that for high enough values of saddle-splay elastic constant

              a previously unstable conformation can be stabilised, more generally indicating that the saddle-splay can reverse or change the (meta)stability of various nematic structures affecting their phase diagrams. Furthermore, we investigate saddle-splay elasticity in the geometry of highly curved boundaries – the colloidal particle knots in nematic – where the local curvature of the particles induces complex spatial variations of the saddle-splay contributions.

	abstract = {Significance
            Thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) are central to a wide range of commercial and emerging technologies. Lyotropic, aqueous-based LCs are common in nature, but applications have been scarce. The current understanding of their behavior is limited, and manipulating their mechanical and dynamic characteristics has been challenging. Here we show that the elasticity and temporal evolution of biopolymer-based nematic systems can be inferred from simple optical microscopy measurements, and that their mechanical properties can be manipulated by adjusting certain molecular characteristics, such as the product of length and concentration. It is also shown that the dynamic evolution of the resulting materials can be understood and predicted on the basis of a free energy functional originally developed for the study of thermotropic systems.
          , 
            
              Achieving control and tunability of lyotropic materials has been a long-standing goal of liquid crystal research. Here we show that the elasticity of a liquid crystal system consisting of a dense suspension of semiflexible biopolymers can be manipulated over a relatively wide range of elastic moduli. Specifically, thin films of actin filaments are assembled at an oil–water interface. At sufficiently high concentrations, one observes the formation of a nematic phase riddled with

              topological defects, characteristic of a two-dimensional nematic system. As the average filament length increases, the defect morphology transitions from a U shape into a V shape, indicating the relative increase of the material’s bend over splay modulus. Furthermore, through the sparse addition of rigid microtubule filaments, one can gain additional control over the liquid crystal’s elasticity. We show how the material’s bend constant can be raised linearly as a function of microtubule filament density, and present a simple means to extract absolute values of the elastic moduli from purely optical observations. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict not only the static structure of the material, including its topological defects, but also the evolution of the system into dynamically arrested states. Despite the nonequilibrium nature of the system, our continuum model, which couples structure and hydrodynamics, is able to capture the annihilation and movement of defects over long time scales. Thus, we have experimentally realized a lyotropic liquid crystal system that can be truly engineered, with tunable mechanical properties, and a theoretical framework to capture its structure, mechanics, and dynamics.},

          , 
            The motion of topological defects is an important feature of the dynamics of all liquid crystals, and is especially conspicuous in active liquid crystals. Understanding defect motion is a challenging theoretical problem, because the dynamics of orientational order is coupled with backflow of the fluid, and because a liquid crystal has several distinct viscosity coefficients. Here, we suggest a coarse-grained, variational approach, which describes the motion of defects as effective “particles”. For passive liquid crystals, the theory shows how the drag depends on defect orientation, and shows the coupling between translational and rotational motion. For active liquid crystals, the theory provides an alternative way to describe motion induced by the activity coefficient.},

By combining the principles of Hamiltonian mechanics with those of irreversible thermodynamics, Antony N. Beris and Brian J. Edwards, renowned authorities on the subject, expertly describe the complex interplay between conservative and dissipative processes. Throughout the book, the authors emphasize the evaluation of the free energy--largely based on ideas from statistical mechanics--and how to fit the values of the phenomenological parameters against those of microscopic models. With Thermodynamics of Flowing Systems in hand, mathematicians, engineers, and physicists involved with the theoretical study of flow behavior in structurally complex media now have a superb, self-contained theoretical framework on which to base their modeling efforts.

Through theoretical and numerical analysis of Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard models, we investigate the potential problems of using partially implicit schemes, demonstrate the importance of using fully implicit schemes and discuss the limitation of energy stability that are often used to evaluate the quality of a numerical scheme for phase-field modeling. In particular, we make the following observations: 1. a convex splitting scheme (CSS in short) can be equivalent to some fully implicit scheme (FIS in short) with a much different time scaling and thus it may lack numerical accuracy; 2. most implicit schemes are energy-stable if the time-step size is sufficiently small; 3. a traditionally known conditionally energy-stable scheme still possesses an unconditionally energy-stable physical solution; 4. an unconditionally energy-stable scheme is not necessarily better than a conditionally energy-stable scheme when the time step size is not small enough; 5. a first-order FIS for the Allen–Cahn model can be devised so that the maximum principle will be valid on the discrete level and hence the discrete phase variable satisfies {\textbar}uh(x){\textbar} ≤ 1 for all x and, furthermore, the linearized discretized system can be effectively preconditioned by discrete Poisson operators.},

    abstract = { 6.1. Introduction Iterative algorithms for solving Ax=b are used when methods such as Gaussian elimination require too much time or too much space. Methods such as Gaussian elimination, which compute the exact answers after a finite number of steps (in the absence of roundoff!), are called direct methods. In contrast to direct methods, iterative methods generally do not produce the exact answer after a finite number of steps but decrease the error by some fraction after each step. Iteration ceases when the error is less than a user-supplied threshold. The final error depends on how many iterations one does as well as on properties of the method and the linear system. Our overall goal is to develop methods that decrease the error by a large amount at each iteration and do as little work per iteration as possible. Much of the activity in this field involves exploiting the underlying mathematical or physical problem that gives rise to the linear system in order to design better iterative methods. The underlying problems are often finite difference or finite element models of physical systems, usually involving a differential equation. There are many kinds of physical systems, differential equations, and finite difference and finite element models, and so many methods. We cannot hope to cover all or even most interesting situations, so we will limit ourselves to a model problem, the standard finite difference approximation to Poisson's equation on a square. Poisson's equation and its close relation, Laplace's equation, arise in many applications, including electromagnetics, fluid mechanics, heat flow, diffusion, and quantum mechanics, to name a few. In addition to describing how each method works on Poisson's equation, we will indicate how generally applicable it is, and describe common variations. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 6.2 describes on-line help and software for iterative methods discussed in this chapter. Section 6.3 describes the formulation of the model problem in detail. Section 6.4 summarizes and compares the performance of (nearly) all the iterative methods in this chapter for solving the model problem. }

	abstract = {Liquid crystal has been a platform for studying and visualizing topological defects, yet it has been a challenge to resolve three-dimensional structures of dynamically evolving singular topological defects. Here we report a confocal observation of dynamics of disclination lines -- the most basic kind of defects in nematic liquid crystal -- relaxing from an electrically driven turbulent state. We focus in particular on reconnections, characteristic of such line defects. We find a scaling law for in-plane reconnection events, by which the distance between reconnecting disclinations decreases by the square root of time to the reconnection. Moreover, we show that apparently asymmetric dynamics of reconnecting disclinations is actually symmetric in a co-moving frame, in marked contrast to the two-dimensional counterpart whose asymmetry is established. We argue, with experimental supports, that this is because of symmetric twist configurations that disclinations take spontaneously, thanks to the topology that allows rotation of winding axis. Our work illustrates a general mechanism for such spontaneous symmetry restoring, which can take place if topologically distinct asymmetric objects in lower dimensions become homeomorphic in higher dimensions.},

Locally{,} they may resemble +1/2 or −1/2 defects in 2D nematic phases{,} or they may have 3D twist. Here{,} we analyze the structure in terms of the director deformation modes around the disclination{,} as well as the nematic order tensor inside the disclination core. Based on this analysis{,} we construct a vector to represent the orientation of the disclination{,} as well as tensors to represent higher-order structure. We apply this method to simulations of a 3D disclination arch{,} and determine how the structure changes along the contour length. We then use this geometric analysis to investigate three types of forces acting on a disclination: Peach–Koehler forces due to external stress{,} interaction forces between disclination lines{,} and active forces. These results apply to the motion of disclination lines in both conventional and active liquid crystals."}

Duclos et al. report the experimental visualization of the structure and dynamics of disclination loops in active, three-dimensional nematics using light-sheet microscopy to watch the motion of nematic molecules driven by the motion of microtubule bundles (see the Perspective by Bartolo). This setup makes it possible to directly watch the nucleation, deformation, recombination, and collapse of spatially extended topological defects in three dimensions. Science, this issue p. 1120; see also p. 1075 Light-sheet microscopy reveals the chaotic behavior of disclination loops in active nematic liquid crystals. Topological structures are effective descriptors of the nonequilibrium dynamics of diverse many-body systems. For example, motile, point-like topological defects capture the salient features of two-dimensional active liquid crystals composed of energy-consuming anisotropic units. We dispersed force-generating microtubule bundles in a passive colloidal liquid crystal to form a three-dimensional active nematic. Light-sheet microscopy revealed the temporal evolution of the millimeter-scale structure of these active nematics with single-bundle resolution. The primary topological excitations are extended, charge-neutral disclination loops that undergo complex dynamics and recombination events. Our work suggests a framework for analyzing the nonequilibrium dynamics of bulk anisotropic systems as diverse as driven complex fluids, active metamaterials, biological tissues, and collections of robots or organisms.}}
